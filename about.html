          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I am a 25-year-old guy from Bulgaria. In my younger years I competed
            a lot in IT, Mathematics, and Physics. After school, I went to
            experience the wider world for some years in university while
            dabbling in some projects. Now I live in a small village with my
            grandparents with a focus on professional development and my family.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            During my middle and high school years in Bulgaria (2010-2018), my
            main focus was on IT, Mathematics, and Physics. I graduated with an
            average of 5.73 and had the lowest grade in music out of my peers (I
            still like to believe my musical skill was just hard to
            conventionally measure).
          </p>
          <p>
            During my high school years, I went to a lot of extracurricular
            activities which allowed me to see what I was capable of compared to
            my peers from all over the country during many competitions. All the
            learning and competing gave me a lot of amazing memories as well as
            the opportunity to travel across the country and even abroad it,
            plus a free admission to our country's most prestigious university
            when I was graduating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the aforementioned free admission, I wanted to try my luck
            abroad so I studied for an English Certificate and earned a C2
            Cambridge level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ended up going to the University of Applied Sciences - Saxion in
            Deventer, Netherlands, with a Software Engineering Bachelor
            (2019-2021). I aced my first year and got the "Getuigschrift
            propedeuse HBO First Year Certificate". I ended up stopping my
            studies after the end of my 3rd year's 1st semester around the whole
            COVID pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            After leaving my studies in the Netherlands I continued to work the
            part-time job I had but now full-time and dedicated my free time to
            software projects. With a team from my country, I finished a few
            projects that are still in active use today.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to return to Bulgaria 2 years ago to help my grandparents
            in their daily lives. During my stay here I have taken my education
            into my own hands, delving into Python, Node & React primarily. I am
            working on paving my own way in the professional world so I can work
            and live without regrets.
          </p>

                Web Development Tutor (2016 and 2018) - After finishing some
                local web development courses in my highschool years, I was
                asked by my tutors to do some teaching for younger aspiring
                developers. I was responsible for introducing them to the basics
                of web development (HTML, CSS & Javascript).

                control for stores all over the Netherlands, the job required a
                lot of quick adaptability, good social skills and a lot of
                persistence.

                Flink Devivery Driver (2022) - I did delivery for around half a
                year as a way to transition into me moving out of the
                Netherlands and back to Bulgaria while also having more time to
                focus on studying and working on projects.
              </p>

              <p>
                Part time employee at Lesto Soft (2022-2023) - Once I came back
                to Bulgaria I took part in a software startup in which I was
                mainly responsible for the prototyping and integrating of the
                frontend although I was active in the backend, documentation and
                presenting. One of our projects "Voice of Employees" won an
                award from the Lean Institute's Tomorrow Redefined conference in
                2023.

                Part time Farmer and Caretaker (2022-Present) - The reason for
                my return to Bulgaria was to help my grandparents with whom I
                still live today in our village. The return for my efforts is
                not monetary but I still consider it as something worth putting
                here.
              </p>

            <li>

                Freelancer (2024-Present) - After taking part in a lot of
                software projects during the years I decided that the
                freelancing route fits my life goals the best. I am currently
                focusing on Web Development but I am always open to branching to
                other fields.
