            <h2>Company Issue & Suggestion System - Voice of Employees</h2>
            <span
              >A software to vastly improve the communication and tracking of
              the connected issues and possible improvement inside a company.
              The core idea of the project is to allow easy communication
              between the different employees of a company which is often made
              difficult due to pen and paper solutions or interpersonal
              communication problems. Voice of Employees won the Lean Institute
              Bulgaria's 2023

            <h2>Augmented Reality Greek God Defense Game</h2>

              >We made the project for the football club Herakles Almelo as they
              wanted a half-time activity to keep their fans engaged. Inspired
              by their mascot Herakles - we made a Greek God themed tower
              defense game in augmented reality. The idea is for every fan
              sitting in the stadium seats to be able to enjoy some quick
              action-packed entertainment while they are waiting for the
              football match to resume. This project concluded here since it was
              happening in the midst of the pandemic and the focus of the client
              had to shift entirely.</span
